**Why Spring**

1. Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring’s focus on speed, simplicity, and **productivity** has made **it** the [world's most popular](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2023/java/) Java framework.

   **it** 代指 Spring。关于 it 的代词语法

   a. 只能指代单数、中性事物（物体、动物、概念、想法、情况等）

   b. 分析逻辑结构和语义

2. We use a lot of the tools that come with the Spring framework and **reap** the benefits of having a lot of **the out of the box solutions**, and not having to worry about writing a ton of additional code—so that really saves us some time and energy.

   **reap:  收获**
   **the out of the box solutions： 开箱即用的解决方案**

3. **Spring’s flexible libraries** are trusted by developers all over the world. Spring **delivers** **delightful** experiences to millions of end-users every day—whether that’s [streaming TV](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0), [online shopping](https://tech.target.com/2018/12/18/spring-feign.html), or countless **other innovative solutions.** Spring also has contributions from all the big names in tech, including Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and more.

   **Spring’s flexible libraries：灵活的库**

   **delivers：传递**
   **delightful： 愉快的**
   **countless other innovative solutions.： 无数的其它创新解决方案**

   

4. Spring’s flexible and **comprehensive set of extensions** and third-party libraries let developers build almost any application imaginable. At its core, Spring Framework’s [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) and [Dependency Injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) **features provide the foundation for a wide-ranging set of features and functionality.** Whether you’re building secure, **reactive**, cloud-based microservices for the web, or **complex streaming data flows for the enterprise**, Spring has the tools to help.

   **comprehensive set of extensions： 全面综合的扩展**
   **features provide the foundation for a wide-ranging set of features and functionality.：IOC 和 DI 特性为广泛的功能和特性提供基础**：
   **reactive: 响应式** 

   **complex streaming data flows for the enterprise： 为企业提供复杂的数据流**

5. [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) transforms how you approach Java programming tasks, **radically streamlining** your experience. Spring Boot combines necessities such as an application context and an auto-configured, embedded web server to make [microservice](https://spring.io/microservices) development a cinch. To go even faster, you can combine Spring Boot with Spring Cloud’s rich set of supporting libraries, servers, patterns, and templates, to safely deploy entire microservices-based architectures into the [cloud](https://spring.io/cloud), in record time.

   **Transforms： 改变、转换**
   **radically streamlining：彻底精简**
   **embedded web server： 嵌入式服务器**
   **make [microservice](https://spring.io/microservices) development a cinch. 使微服务开发轻而易举**

6. Our engineers care deeply about performance. With Spring, you’ll notice fast startup, fast shutdown, and **optimized execution**, by default. Increasingly, Spring projects also support the [reactive](https://spring.io/reactive) (nonblocking) programming model for even greater efficiency. Developer productivity is Spring’s superpower. Spring Boot helps developers build applications with ease and with far less toil than other competing paradigms. Embedded web servers, auto-configuration, and “fat jars” help you get started quickly, and innovations like [LiveReload in Spring DevTools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools-livereload) mean developers can iterate faster than ever before. You can even start a new Spring project in seconds, with the Spring Initializr at [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/).

   **optimized execution** 优化执行
   **By default**: 默认情况下

   **far less toil than other competing paradigms.  比其他竞争的模式更加轻松、且省力很多。**

7. Spring has a **proven track record of dealing with security issues quickly and responsibly.** The Spring committers work with security professionals to **patch** and test any reported vulnerabilities. Third-party dependencies are also **monitored closely**, and **regular updates** are issued to help keep your data and applications as safe as possible. In addition, [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) makes it easier for you to integrate with **industry-standard** security schemes and deliver trustworthy solutions that are secure by default.

   **Spring has a proven track record of dealing with security issues quickly and responsibly. ： Spring 团队在迅速、负责周全地处理安全问题方面具有长期可验证的良好记录**
   **patch： 补丁、修补**
   **vulnerabilities： 漏洞**
   **monitored closely：密切关注**
   **regular updates：定期更新**
   **Are issued to: 旨在、为了**
   **industry-standard：行业标准安全方案**

8. The [Spring community](https://spring.io/community) is **enormous**, global, diverse, and spans folks of all ages and capabilities, from complete beginners to **seasoned pros**. No matter where you are on your journey, you can find the support and resources you need to get you to the next level: [quickstarts](https://spring.io/quickstart), [videos](https://spring.io/guides>guides & tutorials, , [meetups](https://spring.io/events), [support](https://spring.io/support), or **even formal [training and certification](https://spring.io/training)**

   **enormous：巨大的**
   **seasoned pros：经验丰富的专业人士**

   **even formal training and certification.： 甚至是正式的培训和认证**
